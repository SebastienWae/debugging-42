# Methodology

This section is not ready yet...

In the meantime, I suggest you check out [The Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org). It provides very good information and interactive notebooks. The examples are in Python, but the knowledge can be applied in almost any other language.

You can also read the following book:
- Effective Debugging - Diomidis Spinellis
- Debugging - David J Agans
- Why Programs Fail - Andreas Zeller
